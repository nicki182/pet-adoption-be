# pet-adoption-be
Hi, my name is Nicole Strulavits and this is my proyect pet adoption. I learned a lot while doing this proyect, since a lot of this technologies didn't know how to use initially so if someone wants to make suggestions to make it better more than welcome. This is a first aproach. 
## Technologies:
I use yarn on top of node which is faster in certain cases. Node 14.17.0 version and yarn 1.22.0
